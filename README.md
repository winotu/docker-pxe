# Purpose
Purpose of setting all services and configuration just to boot some distro on LAN in containeris simple.
I want to stop filling workstation with unnedded packages, configuration and services to minium.

# Description
`Almost full` PXE boot setup in docker container.

## Why `almost full` ?
Some settings are still needed on the host machines ( firewall rule, IF setup etc.)
But they are described in README files and in future in run scripts.
